## EOSIO.CDT Ricardian Contract Specification ![EOSIO Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/EOSIO-Alpha-blue.svg)

**Spec Version**: v0.1.1

### General Information
In conjunction with [Ricardian Template Toolkit](https://github.com/EOSIO/ricardian-template-toolkit/), this specification is a new addition to the [EOSIO.CDT](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt) suite of tooling.

The Ricardian Contract Specification gives a set of requirements that a Ricardian contract should follow in order to be considered valid. Invalid contracts may still work with non-validating user agents, but will not work with user agents which are built with the [Ricardian Template Toolkit](https://github.com/EOSIO/ricardian-template-toolkit/).

By conforming to a common specification, contracts can be validated and presented in a common way. For instance, Resources must contain a SHA-256 hash value which will allow a validating user agent to check the resource contents and ensure that the resource at the URL has not been altered. Since resources can be used to represent the user or company that is proposing the contract, it is important that the resource URL for the contract is correct and has not been altered since the contract was published.

Ricardian contracts should be written in the English language. The contract itself consists of a set of metadata values supplied in YAML format, followed by the body of the contract, written using a subset of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)-based variable substitution. Future versions may add support for metadata values supplied in JSON format.

### Metadata Fields

* `spec_version` -- *Required*
  * Specifies the version of the Ricardian Contract Specification that the contract follows
  * Value is a string in the form of `M.m.p`, where each version element is an integer representing the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH level of the specification being followed
  * May also be specified as `M.m`, omitting the PATCH level (*see below* for explanation of compatibility)
  * Implementations which process contracts *MUST* follow the version interpretation given below
* `title` -- *Required*
  * Provides a user-friendly alternative to the action name, representing the title of the action
  * Must not contain variables
  * Maximum length of 50 characters (but keeping this as short as possible is recommended, as some user agents may truncate longer titles)
* `summary` -- *Required*
  * Provides a brief, user-friendly description of the intent of the action
  * Maximum length of 116 characters
  * May contain variables, but content with expanded variables must be within maximum length
* `icon` -- *Required*
  * Provides a user-friendly graphical representation of the intent of the action
  * Is required to be a 256x256 pixel PNG image
  * Must include the SHA-256 hash. Contracts containing an icon without hashes will be rejected.
  * This icon may be displayed alongside the Ricardian contract

### Other Metadata Fields

User-defined metadata fields are permissible with one exception. The `eosio` field name is reserved for future use. Contracts containing that field will be rejected.

User-defined metadata fields may contain variables, which will be replaced during contract rendering.

### Other Requirements and Considerations

#### Specification Versioning

The specification version follows a semantic versioning (semver) inspired scheme. This determines the compatibility that may be expected between versions. Versions are specified in the form of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where each element is an integer. Interpretation of these elements is as follows:

**MAJOR**

* Differences of `MAJOR` values imply NO guarantees of compatibility between versions.
* This will indicate a change in the specification that cannot be forward compatible. For example, adding a new REQUIRED field to the metadata.

**MINOR**

* Versions having the same `MAJOR` version but different `MINOR` versions must be forward compatible. Processors of a given `MAJOR.MINOR` version *MUST* be able to successfully process contracts having the same `MAJOR` version and the *SAME OR LOWER* `MINOR` version.
* Processor *ARE NOT* required to be able to handle contracts written to a greater `MINOR` version than designed for.
* This will indicate a change in the specification that is forward compatible. For example, making a previously required field optional.

**PATCH**

* Versions differing only in the `PATCH` version *MUST* be processable by any processor with the same `MAJOR.MINOR` version.
* This will indicate changes in the specification that have no tangible effect on processing. For example, a textual change to the specification intended for human readability, spelling corrections, etc.

#### Variables

All variables used within a contract must have a value or the contract will be rejected. Variable values may be supplied in the transaction, in the contract action, or in the Ricardian clause on the ABI. In addition, the Ricardian Template Toolkit will supply variables about the transaction.

The default scope for variables is the current action's `data` object. The `eosio.token::transfer` action, for example, has `from`, `to`, `quantity` and `memo` properties. Those variables may be referenced directly: `I am sending {{quantity}} tokens from {{from}} to {{to}}.`.

The Ricardian Template Toolkit will supply the following variables, which allow the contract to refer to other parts of the transaction:

* `$transaction` &ndash; Provides access to transaction-level data like `expiration` or `delay_sec`. E.g., `...with a delay of {{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds.`
* `$action` &ndash; Provides access to variables within the current action. E.g., `...using the {{$action.name}} contract on the {{$action.account}} account.`
* `$clauses.clause_id` &ndash; Provides access to data in the `ricardian_clauses` on the ABI. E.g., `Section 2:\n\n{{$clauses.standard_clause}}`
* Items in an array may be accessed by index. E.g., Accessing data in another action &ndash; `{{$transaction.actions.[2].data.from}}`
* `$index` &ndash; A pseudo-field giving you the index of the current item in the array you're within. E.g., `{{$action.$index}}`	

Variables may include a reference to other variables. A maximum number of three variable interpolation passes will be made. If there are still unresolved variables after the third pass, the contract will be considered invalid and an error will be returned by the user agent.

For styling purposes, by default interpolated variables in the output will be wrapped in `<div />` tags, all of which will have the class `variable` and one additional contextual class name:

* Values coming from the default context (the current action's `data` values) will be given the `data` class (e.g., `<div class="variable data">value</div>`)
* Transaction values will be given the `transaction` class (e.g., `<div class="variable transaction">value</div>`)
* Action values will be given the `action` class (e.g., `<div class="variable action">value</div>`)
* Clause values will be given the `clauses` class (e.g., `<div class="variable clauses">value</div>`)

In cases where this default variable wrapping can cause problems (e.g. a variable containing a URL that becomes the value of an HREF attribute) there are additional Handlebars handlers to override the default behavior.

* To prevent an individual variable from being wrapped, use the `nowrap` handler.

  For example, to create a link with unwrapped individual variables:

  `[{{nowrap link.text}}]({{nowrap link.url}})`

* To wrap a larger block, perhaps because it contains a link for an unwrapped variable, use the `{{#wrap}}...{{/wrap}}` pair around the block to highlight.

  For example, to wrap the entire link from above:

  `{{#wrap}}[{{nowrap link.text}}]({{nowrap link.url}}){{/wrap}}`

#### HTML in variables

By default, any `{{variables}}` that contain HTML will have that HTML escaped. This may not be the desired outcome, as the `ricardian_clauses` may have HTML that the author wants rendered rather than escaped.

To accommodate this, `{{{variables}}}` wrapped in triple brackets will have HTML escaping disabled. The rendered HTML will be sanitized to reduce the risk of malicious scripts.

#### Metadata Values Beginning With a Variable or Other Special Characters

Metadata values beginning with special characters, such as a variable bracket (`{`), may not be parsed properly by some engines. Ricardian metadata is YAML, and YAML values beginning with special characters are not valid. To get around this, wrap any metadata values beginning with special characters in single quotes.

### Example Template

The example below shows the metadata in YAML format.
